# My Head Tracking Car

**Warning:** this mod is still a work in progress.

This mod enables TrackIR usage in My Summer Car (and hopefully soon My Winter Car).

## Installation

- [Nexus MSC](https://www.nexusmods.com/mysummercar/mods/147)
- [Nexus MWC](https://www.nexusmods.com/mywintercar/mods/3)

Simply put the `MyHeadtrackingCar.dll` into the `Mods` folder.

## Compatibility

This mod uses Harmony to modify the `MouseLook` class `Update()` method. If other mods also modify this method, then
this might create issues.
